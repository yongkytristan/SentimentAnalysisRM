# SentimentAnalysisRM

This was the final project for the Research Method course, where we were required to conduct a group research project in the field of computer science and submit it to an international conference. Our research focused on sentiment analysis of public opinion toward President Prabowoâ€™s government on social media platform X, by comparing the performance of three language models: LSTM, GRU, and BERT.
The objective of this study was not only to analyze the public sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) regarding the government but also to determine which model performs best in analyzing unstructured data from social media.
My role in this project was to collect the dataset, perform sentiment labeling, and review related research papers as references for our study. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data preparation, sentiment annotation, and conducting literature reviews to support academic research.
